# Challenge

### Background
Coming from the mainland, you know how variable the weather can be in the summer and winter. Your investors want to ensure that there are enough customers between seasons to sustain the business throughout the year.

### Objectives
The goals of this challenge are for you to:

- Determine key statistical data about the month of June.
- Determine key statistical data about the month of December.
- Compare your findings between the month of June and December.
- Make 2 or 3 recommendations for further analysis.
- Share your findings in the Jupyter Notebook.

### Instructions
Complete the following steps.

1. Identify key statistical data in June across all of the stations and years using the describe() function.
2. Identify key statistical data in December across all stations and years using the describe() function.
3. Share your findings in the Jupyter Notebook with a few sentences describing the key differences in weather between June and December and 2-3 recommendations for further analysis.

### June Stats

### December Stats
### Analysis

In the month of June the count, mean, standard deviation, minimum temp, and maximum temp are 13653, 71.04, 3.74, 56, and 83 respectively. Now, in the month of December the count, mean, standard deviation, minimum temp, and maximum temp are 1700, 74.94, 3.26, 64, and 85 respectively. 

The statistics show that the temperature stays relatively constant in both June and December. In other words, the temperature stays between 70 degrees and 80 degrees, implying that it is perfect weather for surfing. The stats from both months are relatively similar.

It is important to note that the standard deviation in June is slightly higher than that of December. Also, the min/max temps in June are slighly lower than the min/max in December.

### Recommendations

1) The surf shop should be good to go in both December and in June. The statistics show that the weather wouold not be an issue during these months.

2) Take a look at the rest of the months, because we care about ALL months in the year. We want to make sure that the surf shop is prepared for any specific months where the weather may not be as "perfect" as the months of June and December.If we have "amazing" weather (i.e. weather >= 70 degrees), then the likelihood of a greater number of individuals purchasing/renting surf bouards/gear is a lot higher.
